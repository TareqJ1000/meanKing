# meanKing
Analysis code for the paper "Experimental Solutions to the High-Dimensional Mean King's Problem" by Jaouni et al. The code can 
- Generate VAA states for any prime dimension using the Hayashi paper construction 
- Computes the path mode polynomials corresponding to each input VAA state when they are each set onto the experimental setup
- Computes/Plots the detector probabilities and the success probability of measurement on a VAA state. Options avaliable for with and without single detector clicks   and also for detector probabilities when sending MKP states as input
- Fine tune the phases in the setup using a naive optimization routine (more or less default configuration from scipy.minimize
